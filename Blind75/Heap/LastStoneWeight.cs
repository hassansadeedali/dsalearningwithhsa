    You are given an array of integers stones where stones[i] is the weight of the ith stone.
    
    We are playing a game with the stones. On each turn, we choose the heaviest 
    two stones and smash them together. Suppose the heaviest two stones have weights 
    x and y with x <= y. The result of this smash is:
    
    If x == y, both stones are destroyed, and
    If x != y, the stone of weight x is destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y - x.
    
    At the end of the game, there is at most one stone left.
    
    Return the weight of the last remaining stone. If there are no stones left, return 0.
